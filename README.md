# Document Tracking System

## Overview
The Document Tracking System is an efficient and automated solution designed for managing and tracking academic staff documents within a university setting. This project addresses challenges associated with manual document management processes, such as document loss, lack of visibility, lengthy processing times, and potential errors. By leveraging modern technologies and methodologies, the system simplifies document creation, submission, tracking, review, approval, and archival processes.

## Key Features
- Streamlined document management process
- Improved efficiency and reduced processing time
- Enhanced visibility and transparency
- Informed decision-making regarding staff requirements, promotions, and terminations

## Development Methodology
The project adopts an agile development methodology, allowing for iterative and incremental development. Key development tools and frameworks include:
- React
- Redux
- React-Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Visual Studio Code

These technologies were chosen for their ability to enhance productivity, scalability, and maintainability.

## System Architecture
The system comprises client-side and server-side components. The client-side architecture utilizes React and Redux to create a responsive and interactive user interface. The server-side architecture leverages Node.js and Express.js to build RESTful API endpoints and handle server-side logic. MongoDB is used as the database management system to store and retrieve document-related information.

## Requirements Gathering
Requirements for the system are gathered through various techniques, such as interviews, surveys, and workshops, involving stakeholders from the university's academic staff. The gathered requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring the system meets the needs of the users.

## Testing Methodologies
Testing methodologies, including unit testing and integration testing, are employed to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.

## Benefits
The developed Document Tracking System brings numerous benefits to the university, including:
- Streamlined document management process
- Improved efficiency and reduced processing time
- Enhanced transparency
- Facilitates informed decision-making regarding staff requirements, promotions, and terminations
